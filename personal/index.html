	<h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <h2>Educational Outreach</h2>
	<p>I grew up in Hillsboro, Oregon before moving to Central California (the SF Bay Area and Central Valley). 
    Making note of the drastic difference in opportunities available to me as a student in each environment, I became involved in educational outreach early in high 
    school as the co-founder of a local organization dedicated to offering free opportunities in community-centered science, engineering, and design. I have since 
    built upon my passion for improving equity in STEM educational programming as a mentor with the Girls STEAM Institute. In college, I co-founded the Wellesley 
    Data Collective, a group engaged in making data-driven conversations about campus issues accessible to all students. We have since held workshops for students 
    of varying programming abilities to get involved in data analysis surrounding campus policing, housing, college government elections, and college responses to 
    COVID-19. Our work on college government elections gained school-wide recognition in this profile. I have also worked with researchers at the MIT Media Lab on 
    developing curricula that engages Boston Public Schools students with conversational AI and GANs.

  <h2>Athletics & Outdoor Fun</h2>
	<p>At Wellesley, I was a walk-on with the varsity crew team my first year before joining our club water polo team, where I have served on the executive board and 
    was named to the Women's Water Polo Collegiate Club Scholar Athlete Team. I have also had the privilege to learn how to Nordic ski and rock climb while 
    taking in New England's beautiful scenery. A West Coast native, I take every opportunity I have to get in the water or simply get outdoors. I'm currently 
    teaching myself how to skateboard while getting reacquainted with my rollerblades.

  <h2>Other Activities</h2>
	<p>I am a varsity debater with the Wellesley Debate Society, part of the American Parliamentary Debate Association. Initially intending
    to major in human geography in college, I enjoy about practicing and learning (non-programming!) languages, am proficient in Spanish and Hindi, and hope to 
    learn Russian and French soon. In my free time, I also play the violin, do origami, read historical fiction, look at maps, try new restaurants
    and look for crazy ice cream flavors to try. So far, mushroom takes the cake.
