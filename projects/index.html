            <br><p>The <a href="https://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/projects/sss/">Deep Space Network</a> (DSN) is the communications network used by spacecraft to receive commands and downlink data. 
    Scheduling when to do so is a complex process that results in high latency as missions wait on one another to respond to proposed equipment and time changes. 
    <br><br> At JPL, I worked with Dr. Mark Johnstonâ€™s team on the Robo Scheduling Services (ROBOSS) project to automate the response process for smaller missions and reduce proposal latency 
    by predicting whether a mission is likely to concur or reject to a proposed change. I analyzed 75 weeks of change history data spanning 40 missions and
    implemented KNN, SGDC, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. Running my model with real-time data would save missions an average of 170 hours a year.</p>

            <br><p>I'm passionate about making sure the future of technology protects and includes diverse stakeholders. As a research assistant with the AIPW,
		I work with former Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Luis Videgaray Caso, and MIT's Internet Policy Research Initiative to study the implementation and implications 
		of systems designed to connect governance and policymaking to AI. 
		So far, I've structured reports on AI approaches to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, data aggregation and COVID-19 contact tracing, and the Chinese
		Social Credit System to advise policymakers interested in adopting artificial intelligence technologies.

    <br><p>I designed an interface to automate analysis of design trades for satellite communications systems. I automated link calculations based on sparse inputs and generated sample plots and datafiles 
	analyzing feasible data rates while accounting for weather attenuation based on location. In my final presentation to group leadership, I modeled communications scenarios for the 
	NASA Global Hawk's remote sensing missions, demonstrating that my interface could accurately model feasible comms under changing conditions and design parameters.

    <br><br><br><p>Previously, telescope adjustments to image stars were performed manually at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. 
	While working as a Winter RA within the Battat Lab at Wellesley College, to ensure that relevant targets are captured clearly and consistently more often, 
	I used OpenCV and performed Gaussian fits to identify objects of interest in static image data before incorporating live video stream. 
	I designed a RaspberryPi setup to test my program by replicating the Observatory's limited computing environment.
