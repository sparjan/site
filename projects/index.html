            <br><p>The <a href="https://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/projects/sss/">Deep Space Network</a> (DSN) is the communications network used by spacecraft to receive commands and relay data downlink. 
    Scheduling when to do so is a complex process that results in high latency as missions wait on one another to respond to proposed equipment and time changes. 
    At JPL, I worked with Dr. Mark Johnstonâ€™s team on the Robo Scheduling Services (ROBOSS) project to automate the response process for smaller missions and reduce proposal latency 
    by predicting whether a mission is likely to concur or reject to a proposed change. I analyzed 75 weeks of change history data spanning 40 missions and
    implemented KNN, SGDC, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. Ultimately, the over the timeframe, using the predictions generated by my model 
    would save missions an average of 170 hours a year in scheduling time.</p>

            <br><p>I'm passionate about making sure the future of technology is designed to be inclusive of diverse stakeholders. As a research assistant with the AIPW,
		I work with former Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Luis Videgaray Caso, and MIT's Internet Policy Research Initiative to study the implementation and implications 
		of systems designed to connect governance and policymaking to AI. 
		So far, I've structured reports on AI and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, data aggregation and COVID-19 contact tracing, and the Chinese
		Social Credit System to advise policymakers interested in artificial intelligence technologies.

    <br><p>I designed an interface to automate analysis of design trades for satellite communications systems based on data rates 
	of interest. I automated link calculations based on sparse inputs and generated sample plots and datafiles analyzing feasible data rates. 
	My model also accounted for weather attenuation based on location. In my final presentation to group leadership, I modeled communications scenarios for the 
	NASA Global Hawk's remote sensing missions, demonstrating that my interface could accurately model feasible comms under changing conditions and design parameters.

	While working as a Winter RA within the Battat Lab at Wellesley College, to ensure that relevant targets are captured clearly and consistently more often, 
	I used OpenCV and performed Gaussian fits to identify objects of interest first in static image data before incorporating live video stream. 
	I designed a RaspberryPi setup to test my program by replicating the Observatory's limited computing environment.
