            <p>The <a href="https://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/projects/sss/">Deep Space Network</a> (DSN) is the communications network used by spacecraft to receive commands and relay data downlink. 
    Scheduling when to do so is a complex process that results in high latency as missions wait on one another to respond to proposed equipment and time changes. 
    At JPL, I worked with Dr. Mark Johnstonâ€™s team on the Robo Scheduling Services (ROBOSS) project to automate the response process for smaller missions and reduce proposal latency 
    by predicting whether a mission is likely to concur or reject to a proposed change. I analyzed 75 weeks of change history data spanning 40 missions and
    implemented KNN, SGDC, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. Ultimately, the over the timeframe, using the predictions generated by my model 
    would save missions an average of 170 hours a year in scheduling time.</p>
