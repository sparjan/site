            <br><p>The <a href="https://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/projects/sss/">Deep Space Network</a> (DSN) is the communications network used by spacecraft to receive commands and relay data downlink. 
    Scheduling when to do so is a complex process that results in high latency as missions wait on one another to respond to proposed equipment and time changes. 
    At JPL, I worked with Dr. Mark Johnstonâ€™s team on the Robo Scheduling Services (ROBOSS) project to automate the response process for smaller missions and reduce proposal latency 
    by predicting whether a mission is likely to concur or reject to a proposed change. I analyzed 75 weeks of change history data spanning 40 missions and
    implemented KNN, SGDC, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. Ultimately, the over the timeframe, using the predictions generated by my model 
    would save missions an average of 170 hours a year in scheduling time.</p>

            <br><p>I'm passionate about making sure the future of technology is designed to be inclusive of diverse stakeholders. As a research assistant with the AIPW,
		I work with former Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Luis Videgaray Caso, and MIT's Internet Policy Research Initiative to study the implementation and implications 
		of systems designed to connect governance and policymaking to AI. 
		So far, I've structured reports on AI and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, data aggregation and COVID-19 contact tracing, and the Chinese
		Social Credit System to advise policymakers interested in artificial intelligence technologies.
