	<p>I'm a rising senior studying Math and Computer Science at Wellesley College. I'm passionate about exploring the role of AI and computational modeling 
		in biological and planetary science research, remote sensing, and operations automation with a focus on data collection and analysis.
		I've worked on technical projects in image analysis, and environmental data analysis, systems modeling, and ops. analysis as well as in 
		non-technical research roles examining the socio-political implications of AI and data aggregation.

	<b>Questions that motivate me:</b>
	<br>
	• How do we build trust into automated systems and computational models? How do we preserve human oversight and engagement as the reach of automation expands?
	<br>
	• As more and more complex biological and Earth system data becomes available to us, how can we visualize it accessibly and translate it into actionable intelligence?
	<br>
	• And broadly, what role do advanced technologies play in empowering how we learn, work, and develop sustainably?
