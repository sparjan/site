	<p>I'm a rising senior studying Math and Computer Science at Wellesley College. I'm passionate about exploring the role of automation in Earth system science and space exploration with a focus on operations & data collection and analysis.
		I've worked on technical projects in operations automation, systems modeling, image analysis, and environmental data analysis, as well as in non-technical research roles examining the socio-political implications of AI and data aggregation.

	<br>
	<b>Questions that motivate me:</b>
	<br>
	• How do we build trust into automated systems? How do we preserve human oversight and engagement as the reach of automation expands?
	<br>
	• As more and more complex Earth system data becomes available to us, how can we visualize it accessibly and translate it into actionable intelligence?
	<br>
	• And broadly, what role do advanced technologies play in empowering how we learn, work, and develop sustainably?
