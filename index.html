	<p>I'm a rising senior studying <em>Math and Computer Science</em> at <em>Wellesley College</em>. I'm passionate about exploring the role of autonomous agents in in Earth system science and space exploration with a focus on navigation, perception, and planning/execution.
		
	<br>
	Questions that motivate me:
		<ul>
			<li>How do we build trust into autonomous systems? How do we preserve human oversight and engagement as the reach of automation expands?</li>
			<li>As more and more complex Earth system data becomes available to us, how can we visualize it accessibly and translate it into actionable intelligence?</li>
			<li>And broadly, what role do advanced technologies play in empowering how we learn, work, and develop sustainably?</li>
		</ul>
